### Hey there, random stranger! ðŸ‘‹

*Thanks for stopping by!*

I'm a Linguistics student at [FrameNet Brasil](https://github.com/FrameNetBrasil) working on `Multimodal Machine Translation` within the framework of `Frame Semantics` under the supervision of [Professor Tiago Torrent](https://tiagotorrent.com).

You can find research-related stuff in the repos below :point_down: and some interesting articles on my [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/viridiano).

Feel free to get in touch via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/viridiano), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/viridiano), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/viridiano) or [Telegram](https://t.me/viridiano) if you have any questions or want to chat. For work-related issues, please use email.

> *This, milord, is my family's axe. We have owned it for almost nine hundred years, see. Of course,
sometimes it needed a new blade. And sometimes it has required a new handle, new designs on the
metalwork, a little refreshing of the ornamentation ... but is this not the nine hundred-year-old
axe of my family? And because it has changed gently over time, it is still a pretty good axe,
y'know. Pretty good.*
